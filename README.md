In the code, as well as the video, the dataset that is used for the faces are from Microsoft's "DigiFace-1M: 1 Million Digital Face Images for Face Recognition" dataset. The link can be accessed below:
https://microsoft.github.io/DigiFace1M/

This dataset has been used for the demonstration of the video and the code submission in order to not restrict any privacy and ethical issues of using other people's faces in the project. The dataset above is used as it addresses ethical issues, especially regarding consent, as "Many existing datasets are obtained by collecting web images without explicit consent. Our (Microsoft's) digital faces are created using a generative model built from high quality head scans of a small number of individuals obtained with consent."

This dataset uses the Research Use of Data Agreement v1.0 license
I used this dataset instead of other public and popular datasets as most of them have issues regarding privacy and consent. Thus, I have decided that this dataset as it does not violate any ethical and privacy issues, and although is synthetic data of a face, it still captures the scenario of face recognition as it includes acceptable facial features and is sufficient for real-world applications.

In the Criterion D video, I have used printed pictures of images from this dataset in order to demonstrate a scenario of students logging in and registering into the attendance system.
